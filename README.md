VC Roles, TTS & more!
https://bit.ly/vcrole

This is a bot that will make your server and voice channels much more interactive, with the ability to give a user a role when they join a voice channel, remove it when they leave the channel, sending TTS messages into voice channels for those times when you can't speak, creating and managing voice channels and more! This is the bot you need to make your servers more interactive, and to help bring a community together.
